# Matrix Multiplication Solvers Reports

This directory contains both LaTeX .txt and .pdf of the reports, one for each solver implemented

## Overview
Each report contains info about
* Techniques used in the solver
* Performance Overview: comparison between the implemented solver and OpenBLAS solver, in terms of execution time and throughput, considering the float case
* Quantitative Analysis: brief analysis of time and overhead in both float and double cases
* Brief comment on the results and expectations
